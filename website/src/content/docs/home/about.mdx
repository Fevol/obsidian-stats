All the stats in on this website were extracted from the public [Obsidian Releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) GitHub repository
and the individual repositories of the plugins.

You can search for stats on a specific plugin or theme using the <a href="" id="open-search">search bar</a>.

## Known Data Errors

Until the 2023-12-21 Obsidian only updated the download count of the 30 latest releases.
This means that plugins with more than 30 releases might have had a lower download count than they should have.
This should be especially prominent for plugins that have been removed and readded to the community plugins list.

## Disclaimer

There is no guarantee that the stats displayed on this website are 100% correct.
Errors might already be present in the data extracted from the GitHub repo, and my script to extract the data might also contain bugs.

## Credits

I want to thank the following people:

- Fevol for his work on parsing Obsidian release data
- joethei for answering all my questions about plugin and theme releases
