All the stats in on this website were extracted from the public [Obsidian Releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) GitHub repo.
The script uses git submodules to extract the data from the git history of the [Obsidian Releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) repo.

:::tip
You can search for stats on a specific plugin or theme using the <a href="" id="open-search">search bar</a>.

## Plugins

The sidebar category `Plugin Stats` contains some pages for different stats for all plugins.

A table with all plugins can be found on the [Plugin Overview](/obsidian-stats/pluginstats/) page.
There each plugin links to a page with more detailed stats for that plugin.

## Themes

The sidebar category `Theme Stats` contains some pages for different stats for all themes.

As for plugins, all themes can be found on the [Theme Overview](/obsidian-stats/themestats/) page.
There each theme links to a page with more detailed stats for that theme.

There are no download stats for themes, as there exists no data in the repo for that.

## Known Data Errors

Until the 2023-12-21 Obsidian only updated the download count of the 30 latest releases.
This means that plugins with more than 30 releases might have had a lower download count than they should have.
This should be especially prominent for plugins that have been removed and readded to the community plugins list.

## Disclaimer

There is no guarantee that the stats displayed on this website are 100% correct.
Errors might already be present in the data extracted from the GitHub repo, and my script to extract the data might also contain bugs.
