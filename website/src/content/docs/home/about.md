description: An intro to Obsidian Stats.
---

All the stats in on this website were extracted from the public [Obsidian Releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) GitHub repo.
My script that extracts the data uses git submodules to extract the data from the git history of the repo.

## Plugins

The sidebar on the left has a category `Plugins` that contains a file for each plugin, named after the plugin id.
The sidebar category `Plugin Stats` contains some pages for different stats for all plugins.

### Known Data Errors

Until the 2023-12-21 Obsidian only updated the download count of the 30 latest releases.
This means that plugins with more than 30 releases might have had a lower download count than they should have.
This should be especially prominent for plugins that have been removed and readded to the community plugins list.

## Themes

There is only a `Themes` sidebar category that contains a file for each theme, named after the theme.
The sidebar category `Theme Stats` contains some pages for different stats for all themes.
There are no download stats for themes, as there exists no data in the repo for that.

## Disclaimer

There is no guarantee that the stats displayed on this website are 100% correct.
Errors might already be present in the data extracted from the GitHub repo, and my script to extract the data might also contain bugs.
