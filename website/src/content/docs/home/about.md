description: An intro to Obsidian Stats.
---

All the stats in on this website were extracted from the public [Obsidian Releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) GitHub repo.
My script that extracts the data uses git submodules to extract the data from the git history of the repo.

## Plugins

The sidebar on the left has a category `Plugins` that contains a file for each plugin, named after the plugin id.
The sidebar category `Plugin Stats` contains some pages for different stats for all plugins.

## Themes

Currently, there is only a `Themes` sidebar category that contains a file for each theme, named after the theme.
More stats for themes will be added in the future, but there will be no theme download history, as there exists no data for that.

## Disclaimer

There is no guarantee that the stats displayed on this website are 100% correct.
Errors might already be present in the data extracted from the GitHub repo, and my script to extract the data might also contain bugs.
